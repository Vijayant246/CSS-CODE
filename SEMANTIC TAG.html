                    Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister arrived for a visit.

                    Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and
                    influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100
                    artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his
                    life.

                    The Van Gogh Museum is a Dutch art museum dedicated to the works of Vincent van Gogh and his
                    contemporaries in the Museum Square in Amsterdam. The museum opened on 2 June 1973, and its
                    buildings were designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Kisho Kurokawa.

            <p style="background-color: rgb(225, 198, 248);">
                Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually completed in
                series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.
                Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix
                with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.
